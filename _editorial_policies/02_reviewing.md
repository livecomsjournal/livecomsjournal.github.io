## Conflicts of interest

A reviewer may not have conflict of interest with an author of paper
they are reviewing. If a reviewer identifies a conflict of interest
when invited to review, they should notify the inviting editor. If a
conflict of interest arises during the review process, they should
immediately notify the inviting editor. For the definitions of a
conflict of interest, see the [definition in the LiveCoMS
bylaws](/policies/livecoms_bylaws/).


Reviewers is to evaluate the quality, relevance, and merit of
submitted papers. Comments should be as complete and detailed as
possible and contain clear opinions about strengths, weaknesses,
relevance, and importance to the field. Comments should be specific
and constructive and suggestions should be intended to enhance the
manuscript.

Specific details on what reviewers look for are set out in the
sections of the [authors guide](/authors/policies/) for each manuscript type.
