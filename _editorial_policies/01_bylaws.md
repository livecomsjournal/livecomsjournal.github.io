1. Organization Title and Publication

   The Journal shall be called the Living Journal of Computational
   Molecular Science, hereafter referred to as LiveCoMS.

   LiveCoMS shall produce one publication, the Living Journal of
   Computational Molecular Science, with articles released on a rolling
   basis online. LiveCoMS provides a peer-reviewed home for manuscripts
   which share best practices in molecular modeling and simulation. These
   works are living documents, regularly updated with community input,
   and can include living or perpetual reviews, tutorials, comparisons
   between software packages, and other documents which aim to improve
   the studies in the field and require ongoing updates.

1. Editorial Board

   The editorial board shall consist of three Managing Editors, any
   number of Associate Editors, and a Section Lead Editor for each type
   of document published in LiveCoMS, and any number of Associate
   Editors. Section Lead Editors may be either Managing Editors or
   Associate Editors.

   1. Responsibilities
       1. The Managing Editors coordinate the operation of the Journal and
          the finances of the journal, maintain the online presence.  Tasks
          may be divided up among managing editors as they see fit, and specific
          individual tasks may be assigned to individual associate editors.
       1. Section Lead Editors handles submitted manuscripts and assigns
          all manuscripts to associate lead editors. They make decisions on
          presubmission letters on about proposed manuscripts, in which they
          may be advised by the associate editors. They make final decisions
          based on recommendations from the associate editors, and communicate
          them to the authors.
       1. Associate Editors assign manuscripts to reviewers, collect
          these reviews, and make recommendations to the Section Lead
          Editors about acceptance, rejection, or requests for revision.

   1. Selection process
       1. Members of the editorial board will be elected as needed by a two-thirds vote of the editorial board.
         1. Managing editors and section lead editors will be selected by a two-thirds vote of the
            entire editorial board from by the other current members of the editorial board when there is a
            vacancy in either capacity.
         1. Vacancies in the Section Lead editors can be filled on a temporary basis by an associate editor selected unanimously by the managing editors until the position can be filled, for no more than three months.
         1. Associate editors will be selected based on:
            1. Demonstrated scholarly expertise in computational molecular science, broadly defined.
            1. Stated commitment to contributed to decision making and maintenance of LiveCoMS.
            1. Candidates will be favored who have shown excellence in the review process, based on independent evaluations
of the members of the editorial board, and who have a history of contributions to LiveCoMS.
            1. Diversity in career background, geographical perspectives, life experiences, and any other factors that are seen as beneficial to represent the broader community, provide fairness in decisions, and include a range of viewpoints.
	    1. All members on the Editorial Board shall be selected in a fair, impartial, and confidential process without regard to race, nationality, religion, gender or gender identity, sexual orientation, or familial status.
         1. Managing editors will be selected based on:
            1. all criteria outlined for associate editors, plus demonstrated excellence serving as an associate editor.
   1. Appointments Terms
      1. Appointment for all positions are for three years (from the
         time of adoption of the bylaws., which may be extended for an
         unlimited number of terms by a vote of two/thirds of the remaining
         editorial board.

1. Conflicts of interest
   1. A 'conflict of interest' is defined as any of:
      1. being a co-author on a paper together for up to 48 months after publication
      1. a co-awardee on a grant for up to 48 months after the grant, or that currently have a cooperative pending grant.
      1. if there exists a postdoctoral or graduate advisor relationship at any time in the past.
      1. at the same institution, or if there is a potential change of institution in progress that would result in being at the same institution.
      1. having a business relationship (such as serving as a consultant for or part owner of same company) within 48 months.

   1. No associate editor will assign a reviewer who is known to have a conflict of interest with any author.  The explanation of conflict of interest will be explained to the reviewer in their invitation, and the reviewer will affirm that they do not have a conflict of interest.

   1. If later it is discovered that a reviewer has a conflict of interest with an author during the review process, this review will be discarded, and another review will be sought.

   1. If a conflict of interest in a reviewer is found after acceptance, the associate editor will evaluate whether any bias may have affected the acceptance. If the associate editor feels they may be bias, a committee of three associate editors selected by the Section Lead Editor will investigate whether any bias or fraud was intended, and will follow procedures to determine whether admission was fraudulent as outlined by the bylaws on fraud.

   1. No Section Lead Editor shall assign an Associate Editor if they
have a conflict of interest with a paper. No Associate Editor may
manage a paper if they have a conflict of interest, and shall notify
the Section Lead Editor if they do have a conflict.

   1. If a Section Lead Editor has a conflict of interest, the
assignments to Associate Editors will be made by another Section Lead
Editor.  The order will be cyclic; if Lead Section Editor A has a
conflict, it will got to Lead Section Editor B, unless they also have
a conflict, in which case it will go to C, and so on, returning to A
when the sections are exhausted. In the case that all of the lead
editors have conflicts, the Managing Editors will jointly pick an
Associate Editor who will then assign another Associate Editor to
manage the manuscript.
      1. Comparison of Molecular Simulation Package Editor
      1. Tutorials Editor
      1. Best Practices Editor
      1. Review Editor
      1. Lessons Learned Editor
      1. continuing with editors of other sections, in order they are chronologically added to the journal.

1. Fraud and Plagiarism

    1. Definitions:

       1. 'Plagiarism' is defined as including any clearly recognizable
amount of text from a previous publication without attribution.

       1. 'Fraud' is defined as any false representation of the circumstances of the paper or the data contained in the paper. It could include fraudulent data, or fraudulent reviews.

    1. If there is a suspicious or accusation of fraud or plagiarism, a
       committee of three members of the editorial board will be chosen by
       the managing editors to investigate.  If this committee votes
       unanimously that fraud or plagiarism occurred, then the paper will
       be removed from the journal, and the author will not be allowed to
       submit to LiveCoMS for three years.

1. Review Process

    1. Review criteria that editors use shall be posted on the author
       instructions section of the website. These review criteria will be
       revised for clarity periodically in response to feedback, with the
       approval of the Section Lead Editor.

    2. Section Lead Editors make the final decision about reviews in
       consultation with the associate editor assigned to the
       paper. In case of an appeal on the decision, the Section Lead
       Editor will select another associate editor to review all
       materials associated with the decision. All authors must agree
       to appeal the decision. If the second editor is in agreement
       with the first editor, the decision will stand and cannot be
       additionally appealed.  If the second editor disagrees with the
       first decision, a third editor will be selected by the Section
       Lead Editor, and a majority vote will be taken, which will be
       final.

1. Amendments

   These bylaws may be amended by two thirds of the vote of the entire
   Editorial Board.  Votes will be are tallied based on the fraction
   of the editorial board responding within one week written notice
   via e-mail or other voting mechanism approved by the managing
   editors. In exceptional circumstances advance notice may be given
   of a rush decision, where the board may be given one week (or more)
   notice that their votes will be needed within a shorter window,
   such as a 12 hour window.
