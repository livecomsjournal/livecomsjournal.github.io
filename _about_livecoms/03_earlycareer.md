excerpt: How students and early career scientists can get involved with LiveCoMS
permalink: /about/earlycareer/
---

We welcome early career scientists (undergraduate students, graduate
students and postdocs) to participate in LiveCoMS.  There are two
ways you can participate:

* If you are a graduate student or postdoc, we encourage you to sign
  up to be a student reviewer.  Every submission to LiveCoMS requires
  a student reviewer to make sure that the material is accessible and
  appropriate for all levels of users. By participating as a student
  reviewer, you will help improve the pedagogical and practical value
  of LiveCoMS to a diverse community of simulation scientsts.  Please
  email [the managing editors](mailto:managing@livecomsjournal.org)
  with a request to be put on the potential student reviewer
  list. Include a brief description of your expertise, and a short CV
  including publications.

* We encourage you to ask questions and provide comments by filing
  issues on the GitHub repositories for individual LiveCoMS
  papers. The give-and-take and community feedback occurring there is
  extremely valuable for continued development and clarity of the
  papers. Additionally, LiveCoMS articles are explicitly asked
  acknowledge students who make contributions via the GitHub
  page. Significant and ongoing participation that improves the
  document may even lead to eventual inclusion as an author on future
  versions (at the discretion of the current authors)
