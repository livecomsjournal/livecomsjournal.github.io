LiveCoMS handles several different types of manuscripts including [Best Practices Guides](https://livecomsjournal.github.io/authors/best_practices/), [Perpetual Reviews](https://livecomsjournal.github.io/authors/perpetual_reviews/), [Comparisons of Molecular Simulation Packages](https://livecomsjournal.github.io/authors/compare_simulations/), and [Tutorials](https://livecomsjournal.github.io/authors/tutorials/).
Authors wishing to submit to LiveCoMS should briefly review our [guidelines for authors](https://livecomsjournal.github.io/authors/policies/) and send a pre-submission inquiry to the appropriate [Lead Editor](http://www.livecomsjournal.org/editorial-board).
Once this is approved, a brief overview of the process is as follows:
- Prepare your manuscript in LaTeX using a suitable public GitHub repository, using our [LaTeX template](https://github.com/livecomsjournal/article_templates) appropriate for your article type, making sure you adhere to the relevant direction in our [General Author Instructions](https://livecomsjournal.github.io/authors/policies/) as well as the instructions specific to your article type (linked below).
- Carefully edit and check the format of your article, since LiveCoMS will neither editor nor typeset your article for you
- Submit a PDF of your final version via the [LiveCoMS website](livecomsjournal.org).
