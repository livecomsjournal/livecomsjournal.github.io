# Best Practices Guides

## What is a best practices guide?
The goal of best practices manuscripts are to improve the quality of simulation research by providing advice that can eliminate the most common errors. 

These documents consist of:

A. **A checklist**: A succinct list of steps that people should follow when carrying out the task in question. This is effectively a *checklist*, provided to ensure certain basic standards are followed and common but 
critical major errors are avoided.

B. **The rationale**: A much more detailed section with the necessary rationale for the checklist, which would act as more complete *best practices* description, with significant detail as to the possible alternative ways to accomplish a given task, when one would be better than another, and significant literature documentation about reasons for choices.

The inspiration for best practices guides can be found in the Atul
Gawande article [The
Checklist](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/12/10/the-checklist),
later expanded in his bestseller [The Checklist
Manifesto](http://atulgawande.com/book/the-checklist-manifesto/). The
main goal of these documents is to reduce common errors by ensuring
appropriate choices are made throughout a difficult task. 

For our purposes, simulation checklists should help users avoid the
most common reasons for failure or incorrect results. Checklists will
typically also be accompanied by a detailed explanation with sources and references (the rationale mentioned above), and this rationale
can go into more detail on best practices and
cover more possible failure modes and how to avoid them. 

One can divide the types of errors that are made performing molecular
simulations into (a) mistakes experienced researchers often make, and (b)
mistakes new users often make, even after having received solid
training in fundamentals of molecular simulation. Most checklists will
be focused on these types of failures.  Potentially, authors might also be interested in helping to prevent the mistakes of naive users who do not understand the
basic principles of molecular simulation. However, normal best practices documents can assume a basic familiarity with the fundamentals of molecular simulations; a separate class of documents can be targeted at introducing novice users to the field, and these will serve as prerequisites for more detailed documents. 

## Additional factors considered in review of best practices guides
Reviewers will consider the following factors in reviewing best practices guides:
* Would following the provided checklist help users avoid significant potential errors in simulation? Will the errors be profound and/or frequent? 
* Are all assertions well-sourced in published data (which may, in some cases, include data created for the paper)?
* Are the explanations clear enough for researchers with only moderate training in simulation?

## Revision schedule for best practices guides
Best practices guides  may start with more frequent versions, as initial rounds of community input are solicited. As always, authors are encouraged to update their private GitHub versions as frequently as desired, and if the document changes rapidly, more frequent new versions on LiveCoMS may be needed; consultation with your editor is encouraged.
