title: Comparisons of Molecular Simulation Packages
---

## What is a publishable comparison for molecular simulation packages?

Simulation comparison papers describe attempts to perform the same
calculation with a range of different simulation programs. 
Such comparison should be updated periodically with different versions of
the same programs (or potentially additional programs).


## Additional factors considered in review of comparisons of molecular simulation programs
* Does the manuscript include developers or advanced users of all programs being compared to ensure that comparisons are fair?
* Are best practices being used in the simulation comparisons?
* Are the methods applied to systems which for which reliable independent data are available?  Are the systems considered of sufficient complexity that readers will find the results convincing and generalizable?
* Have the authors addressed whether a naive user could expect similar performance and why or why not?

## Revision schedule for comparisons of molecular simulation programs
* Articles should be updated when simulation packages have major revisions, or when the standard benchmarks change.
